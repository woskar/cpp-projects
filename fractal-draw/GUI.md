# Graphical User Interface

Options to choose from with C++:
Platform-specific API, such as Windows API, but hard to work with

Cross-platform-API that's nicer to work with
- wxWidgets: free to use, creates native-looking feel
- GTK+ Project, was built to create Gimp
- Qt Studio, big player, not free, but community version

Common with C++: write Backend in C++ and then wire it to a Frontend written in some other language.
